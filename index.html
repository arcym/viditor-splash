                    Viditor is the webapp for video editing across the internet. Viditor
                    streamlines the process of assembling a video by removing any issues
                    heavy computation or bothersome interfaces. Viditor reinvents video
                    editing for the internet, by providing features for connecting to
                    others to collaborate together on a video.

                <p>
                    Viditor is developed from native web technologies, employing
                    JavaScript through both AngularJS and NodeJS to design an application
                    that is accessible from any system on any device. We want to share
                    Viditor, so we've deployed it as an open source project; if you are
                    interested in contributing to the project, you can browse through our
                    repository on <a href="https://github.com/arcym/viditor">github</a>!

                        edit their videos. Any change a user applies to a video is
                        instantly synchronized with all other users.
